# User Story Mapping for Azure DevOps

Azure DevOps is fast-becoming the perfect backlog and pipeline management tool for many teams. We absolutely love their toolset, but it’s just missing one thing — a user story map view. Pair it up with Avion and you’ve got all bases covered.

# Sync all three tiers of your user story map
Our integration utilises both Features and Epics within Azure DevOps to create a true three-tier hierarchy, so your user stories will also maintain the context of their respective user journeys.

# Don't want to sync all three tiers?
You can also integrate with Azure DevOps without syncing the structure and hierarchy of your story map — keeping your Avion stories and Azure DevOps work items in sync — without touching your Epics and Features. This lightweight approach allows your dev team to organise their backlog however they want.
