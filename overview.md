## Put your entire product backlog in a user story map

**[Our integration](https://www.avion.io/user-story-mapping-with-azure-devops/)** utilises both Features and Epics within Azure DevOps to create a true three-tier hierarchy, so your user stories will also maintain the context of their respective user journeys.

#### Don't want to sync all three tiers?

You can also integrate with Azure DevOps without syncing the structure and hierarchy of your story map â€” keeping your Avion stories and Azure DevOps work items in sync â€” without touching your Epics and Features. This lightweight approach allows your dev team to organise their backlog however they want.

## Automatic two-way syncing, always

Whenever a release or user story is pushed from Avion to Azure DevOps, all data will be kept in sync whichever tool is used to update it. So you can update your titles, descriptions, story sizes or structure, safely in the knowledge that both tools are up-to-date.
