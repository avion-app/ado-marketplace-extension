## User Story Mapping with Avion and Azure DevOps

Azure DevOps is fast-becoming the perfect backlog and pipeline management tool for many teams. We absolutely love their toolset, but it's just missing one thing â€” a user story map. Integrate your project with [Avion](https://www.avion.io) and you've got all your bases covered. **Get started today with our free 14-day trial.**

## Visualize your epics, features and stories in a story map
Our integration utilises both Features and Epics within Azure DevOps to create a true three-tier hierarchy, so your user stories will also maintain the context of their respective user journeys.

## Don't want to sync all three tiers?
You can also integrate with Azure DevOps without syncing the structure and hierarchy of your story map â€” keeping your Avion stories and Azure DevOps work items in sync â€” without touching your Epics and Features. This lightweight approach allows your dev team to organise their backlog however they want.
